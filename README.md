Introduction to Neumorphism  Stin Androidudio with BMI Calculator

 Neumorphism is a design concept used to make soft widgets based on object shadows. It uses highlights and shadows to create elements that appear to be floating above the surface.

 In other words, the object seems to extrude from the background. Its aesthetic is made to implement actual Android components.

## The following image shows a BMI Calculator app created using the neumorphic design:

# How neumorphism works
Neumorphism design structure relies on a shadowing system. This approach elevates an object above the base layer. As a result, it creates realistic and unique-looking elements.

For example, consider an object with a source of light at one corner. The object will have two layers of box shadows. One layer is darker which acts as a shadow while the other area is lighter.

Therefore, this means that if there is a light source:

There will be a white box-shadow in the direction of the light.
There will also be a black box-shadow in the opposite direction.
Neumorphism will show the following shadows and highlights depending on the light source.
